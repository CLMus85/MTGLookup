I am learning python as a beginner and have been working on a 
simple script for requesting from the scryfall api for 
					        
						*

					Magic the Gathering
				      A Richard Garfield Game
						
						*

As well as helping my friend expand on a bot for Slack
that responds to queries from chat.

Any help is appreciated
